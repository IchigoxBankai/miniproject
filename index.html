    Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games.[1] Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams.[2]

Multiplayer competitions were long a part of video game culture, but were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when the advent of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, enabled a surge in participation by professional gamers and spectators.[3][4] By the 2010s, esports was a major part of the video game industry, with many game developers designing for and funding for tournaments and other events.

    <p>One of the best things about sports is the way that there's something for everyone. The sheer amount and diversity of sports means that people who enjoy many different things can tune in and find a sport that they enjoy. In the last few decades, a new category of sport has joined the likes of baseball, basketball and football: Esports. 

        Esports are video games being played professionally at a highly competitive level. In the same way as you have pros in things like Basketball, there are now pros in a variety of esports like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, Dota 2, and Fortnite.  What began as an industry in back rooms and crowded auditoriums now fills stadiums worldwide, with top players making six figures in most of the tier-1 games.</p>
